# VBA-challenge

This project uses a VBA script to analyze stock market data. It goes through each sheet in an excel doc and outputs the following information:

* The ticker symbol.
* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.

It also provides some conditional formatting that will highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.
